uC/OS-II RTOS on EFM32 using example.

This is a port of the uC/OS-II RTOS from Micrium Inc, http://www.micrium.com

The port has been adapted by Energy Micro for use with our Development
Kit. It requires the standard EFM32 CMSIS package (including emlib).

The example has three tasks:
 - Task1: LED blink task
 - Task2: Receives characters from serial port and posts message to Task3
 - Task3: Receives message from Task2 and writes it on TFT display

Standard output is redirected to TFT display and standard input is UART1.

Note: The Keil toolchain port does not support FPU context preservation
      across tasks.

uC/OS-II is provided in source form for FREE evaluation, for educational use
or for peaceful research.

If you plan on using uC/OS-II in a commercial product you need to contact
Micriµm to properly license its use in your product. We provide ALL the

The fact that the source is provided does NOT mean that you can use it without
paying a licensing fee.
