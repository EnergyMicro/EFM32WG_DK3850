uC/OS-III RTOS on EFM32 using example.

This is a port of the uC/OS-III RTOS from Micrium Inc, http://www.micrium.com

The port has been adapted by Energy Micro for use with our Development Kit..
It requires the standard EFM32 CMSIS package (including emlib).

The example has three tasks:
 - Task1: LED blink task
 - Task2: Receives characters from serial port and posts message to Task3
 - Task3: Receives message from Task2 and writes it on TFT display

Standard output is redirected to TFT display and standard input is UART1.

Note: The Keil toolchain port does not support FPU context preservation
      across tasks.

uC/OS-III is provided in source form for FREE evaluation, for educational use
